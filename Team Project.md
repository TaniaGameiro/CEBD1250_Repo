# CEBD 1250 - Big Data Storage

### Team Project: Tania Oliveira Gameiro & Nora Arouchian

### Context and Project information
Our client TORA Communications Inc. wants to create an HR platform where you can search and quickly find employee information. Currently all employee information is in Excel documents spread out on different HR and Payroll employees desktops in different formats. 
They would need centralize all of the information into one database and combine all of the spreadsheets to get all of one employees information in one place.

Since the client currently doesn't have a database, we will build a relational database in order to store all of the clients employee data. Once we define the physical implementation, we will look into which tool will suite our needs.
